Just some AoC2022 practice I was doing for Rust.
# How to test
If you'd like to run these solutions it is pretty simple.
Open main.rs in your editor of choice and change what is in the body
of the function to align with whatever day you would like it to run.
Finally, you just need to cargo run it. I don't know if anyone will
ever see this, but if you do, then I hope it helps!
